# Notes-on-Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests
These are my notes for the [Insight](https://www.insightdata.ai/) interview prep workshop I led on Random Forests. They are based on chapters 6 and 7 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow* by Aur&eacute;lien G&eacute;ron, https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml. 

The structure of the notebook is as follows:

- Decision Trees and Random Forests
  - Setup
- Decision Trees
  - Training and Visualizing a Decision Tree
  - Making Predictions
    - Predicting classes and class probabilities
    - The CART training algorithm
  - Regularization Hyperparameters
  - Regression
- Ensemble Learning and Random Forests
  - Voting Classifiers
  - Bagging and Pasting
  - Random Forests
    - Feature importance
  - Boosting
    - Gradient boosting
  - Exercise

Note that MathJax does not appear to be properly working in the Jupyter Notebook uploaded on GitHub, as opposed to on my computer, so the equations are not being visualized correctly.
