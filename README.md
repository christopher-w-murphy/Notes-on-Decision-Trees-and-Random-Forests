# Notes-on-Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests
These are my notes for the [Insight](https://www.insightdata.ai/) interview prep workshop I led on Random Forests. They are based on chapters 6 and 7 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow* by Aur&eacute;lien G&eacute;ron, https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml. Note MathJax does not appear to be properly working in the Jupyter Notebook uploaded on GitHub, as opposed to on my computer, so the equations are not being visualized correctly.
